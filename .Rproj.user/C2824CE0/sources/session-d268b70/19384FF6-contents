Cluster indices for the \eqn{K}--means algorithm for compositional data using the \eqn{\alpha}--transformation
}

\description{
Cluster indices for the \eqn{K}--means algorithm for compositional data using the \eqn{\alpha}--transformation.
}

\usage{
alfa.cikmeans(x, ncl = 10, trim = 0, a = seq(-1, 1, by = 0.1), max.iters = 50,
nstart = 10)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A matrix with the compositional data.
}
\item{ncl}{
The maximum number of clusters to try. The minimum number of clusters is 2.
}
\item{trim}{
A number in [0, 1). If trim = 0, then the classical \eqn{K}--means algorithm is performed.
If you chose a number higher than 0 then the trimmed \eqn{K}--means of Garcia-Escudero et al. (2008) is performed.
}
\item{a}{
A vector with a grid of values of the power transformation, it has to be
between -1 and 1. If zero values are present it has to be greater than 0.
If a=0, the isometric log-ratio transformation is applied.
}
\item{max.iters}{
The maximum number of iterations allowed during the \eqn{K}--means algortihm.
}
\item{nstart}{
How many random starts to perform?
}
}

\details{
The \eqn{\alpha}--transformation is applied to the compositional data, and then the \eqn{K}--means algorithm is performed and a series of cluster validity indices are computed.
}

\value{
A list inclusing:
\item{min_crit}{
A matrix with 9 columns and at least one row, where each column contains the value of a cluster validity index, whose minimal vlaue is preferred. Each row corresponds to a specific number of clusters, starting from 2 up to ncl.
}
\item{best_min}{
The number of clusters selected based upon the minimal valued cluster validity indices.
}
\item{max_crit}{
A matrix with 24 columns and at least one row, where each column contains the value of a cluster validity index, whose minimal vlaue is preferred. Each row corresponds to a specific number of clusters, starting from 2 up to ncl.
}
\item{best_max}{
The number of clusters selected based upon the maximal valued cluster validity indices.
}
\item{cluster}{
If the argument "all" is TRUE, then the clustering indices of each observation for each number of clusters will be returned in a matrix, where each column corresponds to the clustering of each number of clusters.
